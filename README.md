11: ✅ Start Date(10/8/2025)-Expected End Date(19/8/2025) 10 Days of study excluding Weekends(Because I have free time since it's short sem and I have only one subject).
        I didn't study somedays, so I finished it late at the end of the month(31/8/2025).
12: ✅ Start Date(1/9/2025)-Expected End Date(15/9/2025). End Date: 05/09/2025. The course was about data structures and it was more theoretical, I learned new data structures, and it was easy for to understand, that's why I finished it before my expected end date.
13: ⚒️ Start Date: 06/09/2025 Expected End Date: 26/09/2025.
